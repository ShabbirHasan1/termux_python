# termux_python

`termux_python` provides python bindings for the awesome https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:API

I do not frequently work on this project, and most of the code was written on my phone (thanks termux) while being
on the subway.

## TODO

- Better api design (use meta programming instead of declaring each functions)
- Add examples
- pip package

Any contributions are welcome.
